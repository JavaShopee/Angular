Angular is based on Component based approach to develop web application. The very first thing that you need to think while creating web application is : 

What are the components that you need to build ?

Like Header component, Body component , Side Bar Component , Footer Componentâ€¨
Component : Self sufficient entity that knows how to render itself

You will not be thinking about HTML and JS , but about components.

Components can have sub components.
Commands :

>>node -v

Package manager for node :

>>npm -v 

>>npm install @angular/cli -g

Ng is the command to run Angular CLI

>>ng new first-project

node_modules : contains downloaded dependencies
package.json : list all third party dependencies that we need


>> ng serve (to run the project) will create local development server

>>ng generate component component-name

Annotation is TS way of adding meta data to classes

Create a Date Component and get Current Date and Time reflected on it. It should be updated every second.

{{ }} >> Known as String Interpolation, Expression Interpolation. It looks at the content , not as static text
but some thing that needs to be evaluated. 

Angular enters into evaluation mode.{{ 1+1 }}. Not just referring to Member variable, it's doing evaluation.
{{ somevariable + 1 }} >> Mixup
{{ someFunction(1,2) }}
{{ someFunction(someNumber,2) }}

func1(a:number,b:number)
{
   return a + b;
}
{{ func1(3,4) }}
